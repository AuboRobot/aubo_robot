1. support controlling diffrent robots at the same time.
   1)Remapping /joint_states topic
     When you run a move group node, you may need to remap the topic /joint_states to /robot/joint_states, otherwise MoveIt! wonâ€™t have feedback from the joints. To do this remapping you could make a simple launch file for your node as follows:
	<node pkg="moveit_ros_move_group" type="move_group" name="any_name" output="screen">
	  <remap from="joint_states" to="robot/joint_states"/>
	</node>
    Or you can make a subscriber with the correct topic name and then ensure that the starting robot state for your move group corresponds to a correct joints angle by using the call back of this subscriber.

2. Aubo robot Calibration Toolbox
